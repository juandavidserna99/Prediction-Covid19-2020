# Is there a new peak of Covid-19 contagion in Colombia? (2020)
### How to create a model that describes the covid's behavior
Colombia has increased the number of Covid-19 infections and in turn, exceeded the figure of a million confirmed cases. The cases have increased gradually, is there a new peak of contagion?
I have proposed a predictive model that allows us to have a vision of when we will be in the new peak of infections, as long as it exists. Taking as a starting point the confirmed cases from October 1, 2020, to October 24, 2020, assuming it is the month where confirmed cases have increased.
