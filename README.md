# Prediction-Covid19-2020
### How to create a model that describes the covid's behavior
We are going to predict a Covid-19 contagion curve, counting as the starting date March 1, 2020 until the current date (October 24, 2020). The data were selected from this date due to the pre-warning of a new wave of infections, where our general objective is to determine on which date the maximum point of it could be located.
